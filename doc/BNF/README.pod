=head1 NAME

marpaESLIF_BNF - Domain Specific Language (DSL)

=head1 DESCRIPTION

marpaESLIF is a Scanless Interface expressed in a BNF format, that is using L<marpaWrapper|https://github.com/jddurand/c-marpaWrapper>, itself being a thin interface on top of L<libmarpa|https://jeffreykegler.github.io/Marpa-web-site/libmarpa.html> parser.

=head2 CONVENTIONS

The marpaESLIF BNF is composed of unicode characters, in any encoding supported by the underlying convertor (L<ICU|http://site.icu-project.org/> or iconv, in order of preference). Unsignificant whitespaces, Perl-like comments and C++-like comments are discarded.

=over

=item Symbol names

They consist of C<bare names>, or can be enclosed in angle brackets if whitespace if desired. They are case sensitive, and can be composed only of ASCII characters. There is no attempt to discard any leading, trailing, or repeated whitespace in angle brackets version, i.e. all the followings are different symbol names:

  this
  <this >
  < this
    >

=item Levels

The grammar can contain multiple levels, the level syntax being:

  ::=           # Alias for level 0
    ~           # Alias for level 1
  :\[[\d]+\]:=  # General form

The level 0 must exist. We will use only C<::=> and/or C<~> in the rest of this document for conveniene, though we are adressing any possible level.

=item Rules

A rule consist of a left symbol, followed by the level, followed by one or more symbols, or a single quantified symbol:

  leftsymbol1 ::=  # Nothing
  leftsymbol2 ::= rightSymbol
  leftsymbol3 ::= quantifiedSymbol*

=item Terminals

There are four types of explicit terminals.

=over

=item * Pseudo terminals

=over

=item :eof

A zero-length terminal that matches only at the of the stream.

=item :eol

A zero-length terminal that matches only before a newline.

=item :sol

A zero-length terminal that matches only after a newline.

Note that the newline is hardcoded to be any unicode newline, i.e. C<(*BSR_UNICODE)\R> in PCRE2 terminology.

The presence of :sol pseudo-terminal anywhere in the grammar enforces the C<newlineb> flag in recognizers, because a C<:discard> rule can contain C<(*BSR_UNICODE)\R> characters, and then only newline count can safely indicate the beginning of a line. On the contrary C<:eof> and C<:eol> work regardless of recognizer's C<newlineb> flag. In particular C<:eol> is doing a positive look-forward of C<(*BSR_UNICODE)\R> in the stream.

=back

=item * Strings

They can be single (C<'>), double-quoted (C<">), or LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (C<“>) then RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK (C<”>) enclosed. The content is any valid unicode character, and the C<\> character can be used to escape the expected right-side quote character (i.e. C<'>, C<">, or C<”>) or C<\> itself.

Only C<i> and C<c> modifiers are allowed.

The C<i> modifier forces case-insensitive match:

  'string'
  'string':i
  'string\'s'
  "string\"s\\"
  “str'"\”ing”:i

Modifier C<c> forces character mode, i.e. the stream has to be a valid character stream.

Please note this is really a I<quoted string>, B<not> a string terminal. I.e. everything inside the quote is taken as-is, with no interpretation.

=item * Character classes

They are always enclosed with left and right brackets C<[]>. Modifiers can start after a C<:> character. A character class class is nothing else but a lexically restricted regular expression.

Alike string, C<i> and C<c> modifiers are allowed. The C<u> modifier is also supported. Code points in the form C<\x{}>or C<\o{}> that are too large requires the C<c> or C<u> modifier.

=item * Regular expression

They are always enclosed within slashes C<//>, and the content must be valid as per the L<PCRE2 Perl Compatible Regular Expression|http://www.pcre.org/> library. Modifiers can start after the slash on the right. Regular expression patterns are by default anchored. The slash character itself must be preceeded by a backslash, i.e. C<\/> in the string I<seen> by the parser (so, in practice, it is coded like this: C<"\\/">).

Regular expressions must be used with care in the two following scenarios:

=over

=item Quantifiers at the end

If the regular expression ends with an unlimited quantifier at the end, i.e. C<*> or C<+>, it is very likely that the data will match partially until the whole input is read, effectively forcing ESLIF to read the entire input. This can break the I<streaming> nature of your implementation.

=item Negative lookahead at the end

If the regular expression ends with a negative lookahead, it can match when you think it should not. This is because negative lookahead does not trigger a partial match. In such a case, you should ensure that your regular expression forces a minimum number of characters in the subject string.

=back

=back

The PCRE2 syntax is supported in its entirety, this include any PCRE2 add-on. Character classes and regular expression share the same set of modifiers, executed in order of appearance, that are:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  Modifiers   Explanation
  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  e           Unset back-references in the pattern will match to empty strings
  i           Case-insensitive
  j           \u, \U and \x and unset back-references will act as JavaScript standard
  m           Multi-line regex
  n           Enable Unicode properties and extend meaning of meta-characters
  s           A dot meta-character in the pattern matches all characters, including newlines
  x           Enable comments. This has some limitation due marpaESLIF semantics
  D           A dollar meta-character matches only at the end of the subject string
  J           Allow duplicate names for sub-patterns
  U           Inverts the "greediness" of the quantifiers
  a           Meta-characters will be limited to their ASCII equivalent
  u           Forces support of large codepoints
  b           Could mean "forced binary" mode
  c           Could mean "forced unicode character" mode
  A           Remove the systematic anchoring
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

Internally this correspond to this set of options in PCRE2:

=item Lexemes and Terminals

Lexemes are meta-symbols that does appear as the LHS symbol anywhere within the current grammar. Therefore they behave like terminals, except that their definition is not in the current grammar. By default such meta-symbol is looked up at the next level. For example:

  rule      ::= something
  something   ~ [\d]

say that symbol C<something> at grammar level C<0> is a reference to C<something> at grammar level C<1>. It is important to notice that:

=over

=item

A lexeme match respects the C<:discard> rules at its corresponding grammar level. Nevertheless no event can happen, except the internal C<:discard[switch]>, C<:discard[on]> and C<:discard[off]> events.

=item

A lexeme match is successful only if the valuation starting at this symbol is successful and unambiguous

=item

The result of a lexeme match is always of type C<MARPAESLIF_VALUE_TYPE_ARRAY> pointing to raw bytes that matched, these raw bytes will include discarded data.

=back

In contrast a terminal is an explicit quoted string, character class or regular expression, e.g.:

  the_rhs_is_a_terminal ::= '"'

Lexemes can be references:

=over

=item implicitely

Without any indication, a lexeme is always assumed to be at the grammar of the next level

=item explicity by grammar description

  X ::= Y@'Grammar Description'

This is working because a grammar description is unique across all sub-grammars. Note that when accessing a grammar by description, the later must have been declared before, using the C<:desc> rule. Therefore a good practice is to forward declare all grammars at the beginning, e.g.:

  :desc    ::= 'Main Grammar'
  :desc      ~ 'Sub Grammar 1'
  :desc :[2]:= 'Sub Grammar 2'
  :desc :[3]:= 'Sub Grammar 3'

=item explicitely by relative level

  X ::= Y@+1
  X ::= Y@-2
  X ::= Y@3

The signed integer is interpreted as a delta with current grammar level.

=item explicitely by absolute level

  X ::= Y@=1

The unsigned integer is interpreted as an explicit grammar level.

=back

=item Discard

Everytime expected terminals cannot be match, marpaESLIF will try to match the special rule C<:discard>. The C<:discard> rule also have precedence if it matches longer than the longest acceptable lexeme or terminal. and can not be ambiguous (else discard silently fail).

=item Parameterized Rules

The important thing to remember is that parameterized rules parameters and expressions follow the lua semantics.

A parameterized LHS must be writen in the form

  LHS<-(lua optional parameter list)

or

  LHS<--(lua optional parameter list)

A parameterized RHS must be writen in the form

  RHS->(lua optional expression list)

or

  RHS-->(lua optional expression list)

The C<--> indicates if the internal processing of context passing is a precompiled lua byte chunk or not. Most of the times you want to use the C<--> notation, as if it you would have been writen like a lua library that is loaded once, this is also the fastest mode. Otherwise the context passing is recompiled everytime, allowing to have runtime dependencies, sometimes useful for debugging, sometimes necessary for your application.

The parameter and expression processings are done using an I<internal> lua interpreter, embedded into marpaESLIF. The output of this internal interpreter is then injected into host's VM using the language bindings.

it is important to note that marpaESLIF will I<always> consider a parameterized RHS like a I<lexeme>, i.e. a grammar terminal bound to a sub-grammar. Therefore no interaction with the recognizer is possible until the lexeme sub-grammar is processed, with one exception: the dynamic lexeme, which is where the end-user may implement specific functionality with respect to parameters and expressions.
This mean a parameterized rhs can also be writen in the form of a generation action name, e.g.:

  /* Call host's recognizer action "external_action" */
  LHS<-(x,y) ::= . => external_action->(x+1, y+2)

  /* Embedded anonymous lua function */
  LHS<-(x,y) ::= . => ::lua->function(x, y) return "read below!" end -> (x+1, y+2)

  /* Embedded explicit lua function name "lua_action" writen inside your grammar */
  LHS<-(x,y) ::= . => ::lua->lua_action->(x+1, y+2)

<luascript>
function lua_action(x,y)
  return "
</luascript>

In any of these cases, the call must be successful a return a string that is a new grammar, that ESLIF will compile and execute as a lexeme. ESLIF will be try to clever to not recompile grammars everytime, though it will use a very basic check: the whole UTF-8 version of the grammar will be kept in memory, and only grammars with a different UTF-8 version will be recompiled.

End-user must take care, because infinite recursivity is very easy with parameterized rules, and ESLIF is not protected against that.

A concrete lua example is e.g.:

  local recognizerInterface = {
     ["init"] = function(self, input)
        self._input = input
        self._nbParameterizedRhsCalls = 0
     end,

        self._nbParameterizedRhsCalls = self._nbParameterizedRhsCalls + 1
  
        local output
        if (self._nbParameterizedRhsCalls == 5) then
          output = "start ::= '5'"
        elseif (self._nbParameterizedRhsCalls > 5) then
          output = "start ::= 'no match'"
        else
          parameter = parameter + 1
          output = "start ::= . => parameterizedRhs->("..parameter..")"
        end
        return output
     end
  }

=item Lookahead

Any RHS surrounded by C<(?=...)> or C<(?!...)> is interpreted to a positive or negative lookahead, respectively. Internally, it is processed like a lexeme, and will result in a zero-length lexeme in case of match. You can skip it in the rule valuation by surrounding again with C<(-...-)>, e.g.:

  lhs ::= (-(?= /anything/ )-)

will do a positive lookahead of regular expression C</anything/> and skip it in the rule's valuation.

=back

=head2 Grammar meta settings

=over

=item Start rule

By default, the first symbol of a grammar of level C<n> is its start symbol. This can be set once with e.g.:

  :start ::= symbolname

=item Grammar description

By default, a grammar of level C<n> has the description C<Grammar level n>. This can be set once with e.g.:

  :desc ::= 'A single-quoted string'

=item Settings sub grammar

Any setting consist of a reserved keyword, followed by C<< => >> or the Rightwards Double Arrow UTF-8 character C<⇒>, followed by a setting-specific value:

  action => myAction
  action ⇒ myAction

When you use the C<⇒> UTF-8 character, it is recommended to say that the grammar itself is encoded in UTF-8 (c.f. C<marpaESLIFGrammarOption> structure).

=item Defaults

By default, symbol action is C<::transfer> and rule action is C<::concat>, i.e. the parse tree value of a grammar is a binary concatenation of every input representation (see the I<representation> section below), without the eventual discard. Stack manipulation may require the trigger of a I<free> function, and this has no default. Only expected terminals or lexemes are looked up, this is the Longest Acceptable Token Match (LATM) setting, defaulting to a true value. You should not change that. Defaults can be set once, for example like this:

  :default ::= action            => defaultRuleAction
               latm              => 1
               discardIsFallback => 0
               symbol-action     => defaultSymbolAction
               regex-action      => defaultRegexAction
               default-encoding  => UTF-8
               fallback-encoding => UTF-16

Predefined actions are available for rules and symbols. Please refer the API documentation to know more about value types.

The C<symbol-action> adverb is how a match within a sub-grammar is transfered.

The C<default-encoding> adverb gives default encoding when the recognizer runs in character mode and the end-user gave no encoding.

The C<fallback-encoding> adverb gives fallback encoding when the recognizer runs in character mode and the end-user gave no encoding nor C<default-encoding>. Then marpaESLIF will try to I<guess> the encoding, and if this fail, will fallback to this setting. This is the desired setting when you grammar accept input in different encoding, and defaults to a given encoding if the guess fail. Please note that, when guessing an encoding, marpaESLIF takes into account an eventual BOM, retreiving the later from input characters if it exists.

The C<discard-is-fallback> adverb indicates ESLIF that :discard should not be tried whenever scan/resume is entered. The default is the safe implementation, i.e. it is always tried, and no grammar terminal will match if :discard matches an equal number of bytes or longer. Nevertheless, if you are sure that the grammar's :discard cannot conflict with any other grammar terminal, then :discard, if successful, will always hit as a fallback alternative. The C<discard-is-fallback> enforces this mode, providing a safe performance improvement for grammars that has no conflict between :discard and any other grammar terminal.

=item Meta actions

=over

=item C<::undef>

Creates a value of type UNDEF.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::ascii>

Creates a value of type STRING, with encoding "ASCII", from the right-hand side representation, guaranteed to be a NUL byte terminated sequence of ASCII characters, or UNDEF if representation is empty. Please refer to the I<representation> section below.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::convert[[^]]+]>

Creates a value of type STRING from the right-hand side representation encoded in the charset specified within the brackets, or UNDEF if representation is empty. I<iconv> convention is used for the charset, i.e. a charset name, followed by eventual options like C<//TRANSLIT> and/or C<//IGNORE>. Any other option depend on how the L<tconv|https://github.com/jddurand/c-tconv> library is built, and may probably not be supported. Note that using the I<iconv> notation does not mean that this is iconv running behind.

Please refer to the I<representation> section below.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::concat>

Creates a value of type ARRAY from the binary concatenatation all the RHS's representation, or UNDEF if representation is empty.

Please refer to the I<representation> section below.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions, and is the B<default rule action>.

=item C<::copy[x]>

Copies the RHS number C<x> (first RHS is at indice C<0>), putting UNDEF if it does not exist. This action is the only one that guarantees that the nature of the RHS value is unchanged.

Meaningful only for rule actions.

=item C<::shift>

Alias for C<::copy[0]>.

=item C<::transfer>

Copies the single RHS number value. This action guarantees that the nature of the RHS value is unchanged.

Meaningful only for symbol actions, and is the B<default symbol action>.

=item C<::true>

Creates a value of type BOOL, containing a true value.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::false>

Creates a value of type BOOL, containing a false value.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::json>

Creates a value of type STRING in the UTF-8 encoding, containing a strict JSON string as per original JSON specification, i.e. it is using UTF-16 surrogates to describe characters above 0xFFFF.

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::jsonf>

Creates a value of type STRING in the UTF-8 encoding, containing a JSON string as per original JSON specification plus infinity and nan extensions. Without these extensions, infinity and nan are writen as "null".

Meaningful for both rule and symbol actions.

=item C<::row>

Creates a value of type ROW, that contains all RHS's values.

Meaningful only for rule actions.

=item C<::table>

Creates a value of type TABLE, that contains all RHS's values. The number of RHS must be odd.

Meaningful only for rule actions.

=item C<::ast>

Creates a value of type TABLE, where the single key is a string containing the lhs name, and the single value is a row containing all RHS's values, or UNDEF if rule is nullable.

Meaningful only for rule actions.

=back

=item Discard

The C<:discard> symbol, despite belonging to a given grammar, is not accessible directly, and can only be set as a meta setting. An event can be associated upon discard completion, there can be multiple C<:discard> statements:

  :discard ::= symbolname1 event => discard_symbolname1$
  :discard ::= symbolname2 event => discard_symbolname2$

Note than when an event is set, this will be triggered only on the C<:discard>'s RHS completion, therefore the RHS of the C<:discard> must be an LHS in the same grammar when there is an event setting and when C<:discard> refers to a symbol.

An explicit terminal can also be set directly, e.g.:

  :discard ::= /[\s]+/                                    event => whitespace$
  :discard ::= /#[^\n]*/u                                 event => perl_comment$
  :discard ::= /\/\/[^\n]*|\/\*(?:[^\*]+|\*(?!\/))*\*\//u event => cplusplus_comment$

this form is highly recommended, because ESLIF recognizes the case where C<:discard> consist only of explicit terminals, and applies an optimization that prevent the intanciation of an internal parse.

=item Events

=over

=item * Event names

They are composed of a restricted set of the ASCII graph characters. Special cases are:

=over

=item C<:symbol>

Transformed to the symbol name for which the event is triggered.

=item C<:discard[on]>

Hook that is disabling C<:discard> rule for the current recognizer. Equivalent to a call to C<marpaESLIF_recognizer_hook_discardb(1)>. Not propagated. Take care, this is a permanent setting.

=item C<:discard[off]>

Hook that is enabling C<:discard> rule for the current recognizer. Equivalent to a call to C<marpaESLIF_recognizer_hook_discardb(0)>. Not propagated. Take care, this is a permanent setting.

=item C<:discard[switch]>

Hook that is switching C<:discard> rule for the current recognizer. Equivalent to a call to C<marpaESLIF_recognizer_hook_discard_switchb()>. Not propagated. Take care, this is a permanent setting.

=back

Please note that the C<:discard[on]>, C<:discard[off]> and C<:discard[switch]> events will I<always> happen if specified in the grammar with an true initial state and if associated to lexemes or terminals. No callback to the end user will happen. This is because these are internal events, categorized as parsing hooks.

=item * Event initializers

By default, events are on, this is equivalent to appending C<=on> after the event name. The C<=off> characters are putting event off at startup.

=back

Lexemes are different than non-lexeme symbols because they are treated in the grammar as I<terminals>, others are not.

=over

=item Pause events

Symbols that are lexemes or terminals (i.e. they are grammar terminals in the common terminology) can have pause events, C<before> mean that the scanning recognized them, C<after> mean they have been consumed, e.g.:

  :symbol ::= symbolname pause => before event => ^symbolname
  :symbol ::= symbolname pause => after  event =>  symbolname$

=item Pause actions

=over

=item C<symbol-action>

The grammar's C<symbol-action> can be overwritten by setting such a C<:symbol> adverb, e.g.:

  :symbol ::= symbolname     symbol-action => ::u8"Custom String"
  :symbol ::= symbolname     symbol-action => Custom_action
  :symbol ::= 'ThisTerminal' symbol-action => ::lua->lua_custom_action

=item C<if-action>

Itapplies I<only> when the symbol is discovered via the automatic scan, or if it is an external symbol: The C<if-action> must refer to a callback in user-land's recognizer interface or in embedded lua interpreter, and must return a boolean:

  :symbol   ::= symbolname if-action => Custom_action1
  :symbol   ::= symbolname if-action => ::lua->Custom_action2

Please note that the C<if-action> will always be called with an argument of type ARRAY (i.e. up to the implementation to convert that to a multibyte string, if any).

=item C<regex-action>

A regex callout is in the form C<(?CX)> (where C<X> is a number or a double-quoted string). The grammar's C<regex-action> is called with a I<marpaESLIFCalloutBlockp> argument that is of type C<MARPAESLIF_VALUE_TYPE_TABLE>, i.e. a hash in perl, a table in lua, and an I<ESLIFRegexCallout> instance in java.

=back

=item Meta symbols events

For any other symbol that is not a lexeme nor a terminal, completion, predicted or nulled events are supported, targetting a meta symbol name. These are I<grammar> events.

For example:

  event symbolname$      = completed symbolname
  event symbolname[]=off = nulled    symbolname
  event ^symbolname=on   = predicted symbolname

=item Generic event callback

The grammar, in C<:default> meta rule, can have an I<event action> callback that will end into user-land's recognizer interface or in the embedded lua interpreter, e.g.

  :default event-action => Custom_action1

or

  :default event-action => ::lua->Custom_action2

  <luascript>

    -- In the embedded lua, globals are automatically
    -- created. During parsing phase, they are:
    -- marpaESLIF
    -- marpaESLIFGrammar
    -- marpaESLIFRecognizer

    function Custom_action2(events)
      -- "events" is a table, exactly like the output
      -- of marpaESLIFRecognizer.events()
      -- This function must return a boolean
      return true
    end

  </luascript>

The event callback must return a boolean, a false value indicates that the parsing failed.

=back

=item Autoranking

Rules can be autoranked, the higest of a set of alternative having the highest rank, default is off:

  autorank is on by default
  autorank is off by default

=item Inaccessible statements

Inaccessible statements can generate warnings, can be ignored, or be error on demand, default is to ignore them:

  inaccessible is warn by default
  inaccessible is ok by default
  inaccessible is fatal by default

=back

=head2 Statements

A statement have a symbol name on the left-hand side (LHS) and zero or more symbol names, or terminals, on the right-hand side (RHS):

  LHS ::= RHS1 RHS2 etc...

There are two exceptions:

=over

=item The I<exception statement>

Its semantic is a single symbol name following by another single symbol name, with C<-> in the middle:

  LHS ::= RHS1 - RHS2

Constraints are:

=over

=item Both C<RHS1> and C<RHS2> must be a lexeme or a terminal

=item Both C<RHS1> and C<RHS2> must not contain sub-lexemes

=back

This mean that the C<LHS> of an exception statement can never be nullable. You must explicitely declare so if this is wanted, i.e.:

  LHS ::=

To understand how ESLIF proceeds, everytime the left-side of an exception reaches the start completion, the left-side match is checked against the right-side of the exception. The longest match that does not match the exception is the winner.

Simple case is when a exception applies to a full match, e.g. the PITarget of XML language:

  <PITarget>              ::= <NAME> - 'xml':i
  <NAME>                   ~ /[:A-Z_a-z\x{C0}-\x{D6}\x{D8}-\x{F6}\x{F8}-\x{2FF}\x{370}-\x{37D}\x{37F}-\x{1FFF}\x{200C}-\x{200D}\x{2070}-\x{218F}\x{2C00}-\x{2FEF}\x{3001}-\x{D7FF}\x{F900}-\x{FDCF}\x{FDF0}-\x{FFFD}\x{10000}-\x{EFFFF}][:A-Z_a-z\x{C0}-\x{D6}\x{D8}-\x{F6}\x{F8}-\x{2FF}\x{370}-\x{37D}\x{37F}-\x{1FFF}\x{200C}-\x{200D}\x{2070}-\x{218F}\x{2C00}-\x{2FEF}\x{3001}-\x{D7FF}\x{F900}-\x{FDCF}\x{FDF0}-\x{FFFD}\x{10000}-\x{EFFFF}\-.0-9\x{B7}\x{0300}-\x{036F}\x{203F}-\x{2040}]*/u

Or any number but '23':

  number ::= /\\d+/ - '23'

More complex is when the exception is floating, e.g. the CData of XML language:

  CData           ::= CHARDATA - CHARDATAEXCEPTION
  CData           ::= # Using CHARDATA removed CData nullable aspect
  CHARDATA          ~ [\x{9}\x{A}\x{D}\x{20}-\x{D7FF}\x{E000}-\x{FFFD}\x{10000}-\x{10FFFF}]:u*
  CHARDATAEXCEPTION ~ CHARDATA ']]>' CHARDATA

In the above example note that CHARDATA is writen as a sequence rule, allowing ESLIF to detect every CHARDATA completion, and match it against CHARDATAEXCEPTION. Although very closed, the following would I<not> work:

  CData           ::= CHARDATA - CHARDATAEXCEPTION
  CData           ::= # Using CHARDATA removed CData nullable aspect
  CHARDATA          ~ /[\x{9}\x{A}\x{D}\x{20}-\x{D7FF}\x{E000}-\x{FFFD}\x{10000}-\x{10FFFF}]*/u
  CHARDATAEXCEPTION ~ CHARDATA ']]>' CHARDATA

An exception can be consuming, eventually reading the whole data if it is writen without special care. Trying to minimize the number of characters needed and/or using well-thinked regular expressions often lead to the same result with better performance.

Internally, the longest C<RHS1> is first matched, then ESLIF rollbacks to every previous C<RHS1>'s completion as long as C<RHS2> matches.

=item The I<sequence statement>

This is a single symbol name following by the C<*> or the C<+> character:

  LHS1 ::= RHS1*
  LHS2 ::= RHS2+

=back

Empty rule have no RHS:

  EMPTYRULE ::=

Eventual ambiguities in the grammar itself may be solved by adding the C<;> character at the end of a rule, or by enclosing zero or more statements within C<{> and C<}> characters:

  EMPTYRULE ::= ;
  {
    LHS1 ::= RHS1
    LHS2 ::= RHS2 - RHS3
  }

=over

=item Alternatives

There are two types of alternatives: the standard C<|> meaning this is an I<or>, or the I<loosen> character C<||> meaning that this is an alternative starting a I<prioritized> group of alternatives, for example the calculator grammar is:

  Expression  ::=  /[\d]+/
                | '(' Expression ')'              assoc => group
                ||    Expression '**' Expression  assoc => right
                ||    Expression  '*' Expression
                |     Expression  '/' Expression
                ||    Expression  '+' Expression
                |     Expression  '-' Expression

which is strictly equivalent, in traditional BNF syntax to:

  Expression  ::= Expression0
  Expression0 ::= Expression1
  Expression1 ::= Expression2
  Expression2 ::= Expression3

  Expression3 ::= /[\d]+/
                | '(' Expression0 ')'
  Expression2 ::=  Expression3 '**' Expression2
  Expression1 ::=  Expression1  '*' Expression2
                |  Expression1  '/' Expression2
  Expression0 ::=  Expression0  '+' Expression1
  Expression0 ::=  Expression0  '-' Expression1

As you can see statements has been grouped at every occurence of C<||> operator. Therefore the I<loosen> operator C<||> is a I<convenience> operator, it is always possible to write an equivalent grammar without it, though this can become quite tedious. The C<assoc> adverb has a meaning only in the presence of prioritized alternatives, else it has no effect.

The following is copied almost verbatim from the L<Marpa::R2 section on precedence|https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/Marpa-R2/pod/Scanless/DSL.pod#Precedence>:

In prioritized statements, every alternative has an I<arity>. The arity is the number of times an operand appears on the RHS.  A RHS symbol is an I<operand> if and only if it is the same as the LHS symbol.  Anything else is considered as an I<operator>. When the arity is C<0>, precedence and associativy are meaningless and ignored. When the arity is C<1>, precedence has effect, but not left nor right associativity.

If arity is 2 or more and the alternative is left associative, the leftmost operand associates and operands after the first will have the next-tighest priority level. If arity is 2 or more and the alternative is right associative, the last operand associates and operands before the last will have the next-tighest priority level. In group associativity, all operands associate at the lowest priority.

=item Adverbs

Any rule can be followed by zero or more of these adverbs, if an adverb appears more than once, the latest is the winner:

=over

=item Action

During valuation, a specific action can be associated to a rule:

  action => my_action

It is possible to set a hardcoded UTF-8 string as result, using a string literal:

  action => ::u8"string literal, supporting \x{0D}, \u{0972} and \U{0001F600}"

where C<\x{hh}> will translate to a byte having the hexadecimal value C<hh>, and C<\u{uuuu}> and C<\U{uuuuuuuu}> will translate to the UTF-8 version of C<uuuu> unicode code point, C<uuuuuuuu> is for the very large, less common, code points.

Actions can be be writen in plain lua, conforming to the lua version embedded by ESLIF, e:g:

  action => action => ::lua->function(x,y) return x^y end
  action => action => ::luac->function(x,y) return x^y end

The lua semantics apply immediately after the first opening pathenthesis, up to the end of the function body:

  action => action => ::lua->function(x,y)
                               --[=[ Lua semantics here ]=]
                               return x^y
                             end

The workflow for lua actions is:

=over

=item 1

Content of grammar's luascript is always loaded first

=item 2

Lua actions are loaded dynamcally:

=over

=item a

The actions starting with C<::lua->function> are always loaded as string, i.e. compiled and then executed

=item a

The actions starting with C<::luac->function> are compiled once if needed, and the binary chunk is re-injected as is for execution.

=back

Internally ESLIF creates a function that returns the user function, e.g. if in your grammar you have:

  action => action => ::lua->function(x,y) return true end

then ESLIF will inject this:

  return function(x,y) return true end

The top of the lua stack is then executed, leaving to user's wanted anonymous function.

=back

=item Left association

In a prioritized statement, associate with the left-most operand:

  assoc => left

=item Right association

In a prioritized statement, associate with the right-most operand:

  assoc => right

=item Group association

All operands associate at the lowest priority:

  assoc => group

=item Separator

Sequence rules can have a separator, that can be a symbol name, a string, a character class or a regular expression.

  separator => comma
  separator => ','
  separator => [,]
  separator => /,/

Modifiers are allowed after string, character class or regular expressions.

=item Proper specification

Sequence rules can be I<proper>, i.e. without trailing separator:

  proper => 1
  proper => true
  proper => 0
  proper => false

=item Hiding separator specification

Default for sequence rules actions is to always include the separator in the stack. This may be changed in the grammar using:

  hide-separator => 1
  hide-separator => true
  hide-separator => 0
  hide-separator => false

=item Rank specification

During valuation, rules can have a rank to get prioritized. Rank is a signed integer and default to C<0>:

  rank => -2

Any other value but C<0> is not allowed if autoranking is set to a true value.

=item Null-ranking specification

Nulling symbols can rank high low, the default is low.

  null-ranking => 'low'
  null-ranking => 'high'

=item Priority specification

Lexemes and terminals can be prioritized, using a signed integer:

  priority => 15

=item Verbose specification

Lexemes can be verbose when they fail to parse:

  verbose => 1
  verbose => true
  verbose => 0
  verbose => false

If C<verbose> is a true value, ESLIF will printout the sub-recognizer state and stream if the lexeme valuation fails.

=item Pause specification

Scanner can be paused before a lexeme or a terminal is recognized, or just after it has been completed:

  pause => before
  pause => after

=item Event specification

Events can be specified, with an eventual initializer, given that default initialization is C<=on>:

  event => eventName
  event => eventName=on
  event => eventName=off

=item Naming

A name can be associated to a rule, in the form:

  LHS ::= etc... RHS etc... name => something
  LHS ::= etc... RHS etc... name => 'quoted string literal'  # No modifier is allowed after the string
  LHS ::= etc... RHS etc... name => "quoted string literal"  # No modifier is allowed after the string

and to terminals in the form:

  :symbol ::= /X/ name => XRegexp

A terminal that has the name adverb can be accessed later in the grammar at the same level using the name preceded by the dollar sign C<$>, e.g;:

  LHS ::= etc... $XRegexp ...

Note that two terminals cannot share the same name adverb.

=item Embedded lua language globals

Every call to embedded lua provide the following globals:

=over

=item marpaESLIF

Lua object representing current marpaESLIF instance.

=item marpaESLIFGrammar

Lua object representing current marpaESLIFGrammar instance.

=item marpaESLIFRecognizer

Lua object representing current marpaESLIFRecognizer instance.

=item marpaESLIFValue

Lua object representing current marpaESLIFValue instance, when doing valuation.

=back

=item Grammar events

The predicted, completed and nulled grammar events have a cost, and when possible lexeme or terminal events should be prefered.

=item Hiden RHSs

Using C<hide-separator> and C<(-...-)>, although convenient, are likely to be less performant than by taking that into account in your own actions.
